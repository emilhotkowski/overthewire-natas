" You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" "
Http has many different headers, including Referer one which tells browser where a request came from.

The *Referer* request header contains the address of the page making the request. W
hen following a link, this would be the url of the page containing the link. 

What about Origin header?
The Origin request header indicates where a fetch originates from. 
It doesn't include any path information, but only the server name.
 It is sent with CORS requests, as well as with POST requests. 
It is similar to the Referer header, but, unlike this header, it doesn't disclose the whole path.

curl -u natas4:Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ 
-H "Referer: http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"
-X GET http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org
