We are given a source code :

if($key != "") {
    passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
}

we can see that there is a direct injection of our input. After checking -i parameter
-i, --ignore-case
             Perform case insensitive matching.  By default, grep is case sensitive.
... it does nothing for us.

Let's try to grep some linux important files like : /etc/passwd
Nothing. So let's try to use pipe operator, which allow us to add extra commads.

When we put "| find * #" we can see files in current directory. So we can pretty much do anything on the server.

And there was a special file : | cat/etc/natas_webpass/natas10 #
That had a password for next level :)
